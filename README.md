### Live chat feature

To run so far:

1. In the root directory, run `npm i` to install all dependencies
2. Start the server with `node server.js`
3. Open index.html twice (these act as the clients for the person seeking help and the helper)
4. Follow the prompts on each page
5. The "live chat" should work between the two pages.
